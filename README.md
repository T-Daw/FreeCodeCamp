Git instructions

Run `git status` to see which files have been created or changed
Untracked files are files that are newly created which git doesn't recognize

Run `git add` to tell git that you want this file to be ready to commit

Run `git status` again to see that git now has the file ready

Run `git commit -m "adding the hello file"`
This will commit the new file to the git repo.  You must have a commit message or git will not accept the file.  This is because commit messages help everybody know what this change is about

Run `git log` to see your commit with its commit message,  Press "q" to exit if you get stuck in the log.
